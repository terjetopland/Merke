# Merke

As a coach for the ski group since 2009, I have arranged ski tests for everyone in the ski group. 
In order to pass the ski test each year, each participant in each age group must meet given official requirements.
If the participant passes the requirement, the person concerned will receive a prize after a certain number of years of passing. 
You can take the test for 40 years, and it is therefore important that the results are taken care of.

Until now, I have recorded this manually with a stopwatch, pen and paper and later punched it into Excel to keep track.
It eventually became a lot to keep track of, and it was then the idea to create an app where I could do all this, 
and at the same time ensure that the data would be taken care of for all the years to come.


The project has taken a back seat in recent months as I've been focusing on my studies. 
When I continues the project - I will probably learn Java and use this for backend and React.JS Typescript for frontend.
The reson for changing language to Java is that I really want to learn this and it offers crossplattform functionallity.
This will be a new project called Merke2.
